## How to contribute

To change anything, either create a new [issue](https://github.com/owen-kellie-smith/avo-website/issues) and describe what you would like to see or create what you would like to see and seek approval for it i.e.
1. [Fork the repository](#download-the-repo-and-run-tests)
2. Make your changes
3. Submit a pull request

The website is in the [docs](docs) folder.

If you are proposing a new page (e.g. `events`), you need to make **three** changes:

1. **Create the content fragment** e.g. copy `docs\contact.html` to `docs/events.html`  
   This file contains only the page content — no `<html>`, `<head>`, or `<body>` tags. Leave the redirect script at the very top so that visiting the file directly sends users to the correct page.  Your new page will look like (once you have finished):
   ```html
   <script data-redirect>location.replace('./index.html#events');</script>

   <h1>Events</h1>
   <p>New content that describes some events ...</p>
   ```

2. **Register the page** in `docs/js/import.js`  
   Add the new page key to both arrays near the top of the file:
   ```js
   const VALID_PAGES = ['latest', 'about', ..., 'events'];

   const PAGE_TITLES = {
     ...
     events: 'Axe Vale Orchestra - Events',
   };
   ```

3. **Add a menu link** in `docs/includes/menu.html`  
   Use a `href="#events"` hash link (not a `.html` file link):
   ```html
   <li><a href="#events">Events</a></li>
   ```

> **How it works:** The site is a single-page application. Only `docs/index.html` is ever loaded by the browser. Clicking a menu link changes the URL hash (e.g. `#events`), and the router in `docs/js/import.js` fetches the matching fragment file (`events.html`) and inserts its content into the page — no full page reload.
